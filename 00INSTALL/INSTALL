Installation Sublime Text


Installation on Debian jessie 8.5 amd64
======================================
1. Download sublime-text_build-3114_amd64.deb
This was the Ubuntu 64 bit package.  Figured I would try this before
downloading the source.

$ wget https://download.sublimetext.com/sublime-text_build-3114_amd64.deb

2. Install package:
# dpkg -i sublime-text_build-3114_amd64.deb 
Selecting previously unselected package sublime-text.

NOTE: Aptitude threw a 'Couldn't find package "."' error.
      i.e. Likely wanted the deb in a repository.


This installed Sublime Text Build 3114 without issue.

3. Run Sublime Text.  Sublime Text is now available in gnome under:
  Applications > Programming > Sublime Text
