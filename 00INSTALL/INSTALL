Installation Sublime Text


Installation on Debian jessie 8.5 amd64
======================================
1. Download sublime-text_build-3114_amd64.deb
This was the Ubuntu 64 bit package.  Figured I would try this before
downloading the source.

"Sublime Text may be downloaded and evaluated for free, however a license must
be purchased[1] for continued use.  There is currently no enforced time limit
for the evaluation."

$ wget https://download.sublimetext.com/sublime-text_build-3114_amd64.deb

2. Install package:
# dpkg -i sublime-text_build-3114_amd64.deb 
Selecting previously unselected package sublime-text.

NOTE: Aptitude threw a 'Couldn't find package "."' error.
      i.e. Likely wanted the deb in a repository.


This installed Sublime Text Build 3114 without issue.

3. Run Sublime Text.  Sublime Text is now available in gnome under:
  Applications > Programming > Sublime Text

4. Install the GoSublime plugin
"Run the command git clone https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime from within
the Sublime Text Packages directory.  The location of your Sublime Text
Packages directory can be found by clicking the menu: Preferences > Browse
Packages...."

i. Run Sublime in gnome:
Applications > Progamming > Sublime Text

ii. In Sublime determine packages directory:
Preferences > Browse Packages...

This opens the ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages packages in a new window.

iii. Change to Packages directory:
$ cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages

iv. Install the GoSublime plugin:
$ git clone https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime
Cloning into 'GoSublime'...

Resolving deltas: 100% (3353/3353), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
$

v. Verify GoSublime plugin installation.  Ran Sublime and this displayed
CHANGELOG.md and GoSublime's usage file:
  ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/GoSublime/CHANGELOG.md
  ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/GoSublime/USAGE.md

5. Test Sublime Text by opening go file:
File > Open File...

Select ~/git/gci/projects/generator-alarms/src/db/db.go

Looks good!  Go syntax high-lighting is correct.
