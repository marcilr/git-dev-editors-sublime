Installation procedure looks good.

5. Create subl and sublime symlinks for easy execution of
sublime_text:

$ sudo ln -s /opt/sublime_text/sublime_text /usr/local/bin/subl
$ type subl
subl is /usr/local/bin/subl
$

$ sudo ln -s /opt/sublime_text/sublime_text /usr/local/bin/sublime
$ type sublime
sublime is /usr/local/bin/sublime
$

5. Test sublime via sylinks:
$ subl      <=== Launches unregistered Sublime Text v3.2 Build 3200
$ sublime   <=== Launches unregistered Sublime Text v3.2 Build 3200

Working well.

Installation on Debian jessie 8.5 amd64
=======================================
1. Download sublime-text_build-3114_amd64.deb
This was the Ubuntu 64 bit package.  Figured I would try this before
downloading the source.

"Sublime Text may be downloaded and evaluated for free, however a license must
be purchased[1] for continued use.  There is currently no enforced time limit
for the evaluation."

$ wget https://download.sublimetext.com/sublime-text_build-3114_amd64.deb

2. Install package:
# dpkg -i sublime-text_build-3114_amd64.deb 
Selecting previously unselected package sublime-text.
(Reading database ... 387249 files and directories currently installed.)
Preparing to unpack sublime-text_build-3114_amd64.deb ...
Unpacking sublime-text (3114) ...
Setting up sublime-text (3114) ...
Processing triggers for hicolor-icon-theme (0.13-1) ...
Processing triggers for desktop-file-utils (0.22-1) ...
Processing triggers for gnome-menus (3.13.3-6) ...
Processing triggers for mime-support (3.58) ...
# 

NOTE: Aptitude threw a 'Couldn't find package "."' error.
      i.e. Likely wanted the deb in a repository.


This installed Sublime Text Build 3114 without issue.

3. Run Sublime Text.  Sublime Text is now available in gnome under:
  Applications > Programming > Sublime Text

4. Install the GoSublime plugin
"Run the command git clone https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime from within
the Sublime Text Packages directory.  The location of your Sublime Text
Packages directory can be found by clicking the menu: Preferences > Browse
Packages...."

i. Run Sublime in gnome:
Applications > Progamming > Sublime Text

ii. In Sublime determine packages directory:
Preferences > Browse Packages...

This opens the ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages packages in a new window.

iii. Change to Packages directory:
$ cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages

iv. Install the GoSublime plugin:
$ git clone https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime
Cloning into 'GoSublime'...
remote: Counting objects: 6377, done.
remote: Total 6377 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 6377
Receiving objects: 100% (6377/6377), 2.11 MiB | 427.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (3353/3353), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
$

v. Verify GoSublime plugin installation.  Ran Sublime and this displayed
CHANGELOG.md and GoSublime's usage file:
  ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/GoSublime/CHANGELOG.md
  ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/GoSublime/USAGE.md

5. Test Sublime Text by opening go file:
File > Open File...

Select ~/git/gci/projects/generator-alarms/src/db/db.go

Looks good!  Go syntax high-lighting is correct.


6. On opening db.go got a GOPATH error:
MarGo: Missing required environment variables: GOPATH
See the `Quirks`  seciton of USAGE.md for info

Checking `Quirks` in 
  ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/GoSublime/USAGE.md:16

Quirks
------

This section assumes you know what `GOPATH` is and how to set it.  If you
don't, please see http://golang.$

In some systems, environment variables are not passed around as expected.
The result of which is that some commands e.g `go build` don't work
as the command cannot be found or `GOPATH` is not set. To get around this
the simplest thing to do is to set these variables in the settings file.
See the documentation for the `env` and/or `shell` setting, both documented
in the default settings file `Packages/User/GoSublime.sublime-settings`

Configured ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/GoSublime/\
GoSublime.sublime-settings:9 with GOPATH:

// you may set specific environment variables here
// e.g "env": { "PATH": "$HOME/go/bin:$PATH" }
// in values, $PATH and ${PATH} are replaced with
// the corresponding environment(PATH) variable, if it exists.
"env": { "GOPATH": "$HOME/gospace" },

That did the trick no more GOPATH warnings when opening go files
in Sublime.

Very nice.

7. The default color scheme, under Perferences > Color Scheme is set to
Monokai.  Not terrible but it sure looks like a Brown background to me.

Updated to Sunburst, with a black background, is exactly what I want.
