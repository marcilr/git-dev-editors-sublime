Installation procedure looks good.

5. Sublime Text includes a command-line helper called subl.
Using the command-line helper, you can open files and folders
and perform other actions from the command line.  Before using
subl, make sure it is on your PATH.  To put subl on your PATH,
you may need to add directories to PATH or use symbolic links.
--docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/command_line/command_line.html

Create subl and sublime symlinks for easy execution of
sublime_text:

$ sudo ln -s /opt/sublime_text/sublime_text /usr/local/bin/subl
$ type subl
subl is /usr/local/bin/subl
$

$ sudo ln -s /opt/sublime_text/sublime_text /usr/local/bin/sublime
$ type sublime
sublime is /usr/local/bin/sublime
$

5. Test sublime via sylinks:
$ subl      <=== Launches unregistered Sublime Text v3.2 Build 3200
$ sublime   <=== Launches unregistered Sublime Text v3.2 Build 3200

Working well.
