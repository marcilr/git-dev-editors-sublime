Sublime Text editor


Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.
You'll love the slick user interface, extraordinary features and amazing
performance.


This is the favorite editor of coworker Whitham Reeve.


price: $80
       Sublime Text may be downloaded and evaluated for free, however
       a license must be purchased for continued use.

       Licenses are per-user, rather than per-machine, so you can enjoy
       Sublime Text on as many computers and operating systems as you
       wish with your license.
