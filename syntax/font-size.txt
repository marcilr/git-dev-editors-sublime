Font Size

The answers are omitting the square brackets, in the case one is creating the file from scratch.

To recap, for the ST3 users who don't have the Default.sublime-theme file (which is actually the default configuration), the simplest procedure is:

Navigate to Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages
Open the User directory
Create a file named Default.sublime-theme (if you're using the default theme, otherwise use the theme name, e.g. Material-Theme-Darker.sublime-theme) with the following content (modify font.size as required):
[
    {
        "class": "sidebar_label",
        "color": [0, 0, 0],
        "font.bold": false,
        "font.size": 12
    },
]
For reference, here there is the full file (as found in ST2).
