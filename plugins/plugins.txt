Plugins


List of use plugins from GCI's Hanh Bui December 26, 2017:

Hope things are going well with your Ruby on Rails effort.
I found the following Sublime Text plugins to be very useful.

o BeautifyRuby
o BracketHighlighter
o Highlight
o Indent XML
o JSON Reindent

Before you can use plugins, you’ll need to install package
control.[1]  Once you have that installed, you can follow each
package installation instruction by searching on
packagecontrol.io site
